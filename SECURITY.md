# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no security specific releases of smelly. Security bugs are fixed
and released just like all other bugs.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Preferably send an email to anders at backbiter-no.net or open an issue in the
GitHub repository, though the latter means you are disclosing the vulnerability
publicly before it can be fixed.
